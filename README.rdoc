A gem that provides text processing routines for Twitter Tweets. The major
reason for this is to unify the various auto-linking and extraction of
usernames, lists, hashtags and URLs.

== Extraction Examples

  # Extraction
  class MyClass
    include Twitter::Extractor
    usernames = extract_mentioned_screen_names("Mentioning @twitter and @jack")
    # usernames = ["twitter", "jack"]
  end

  # Extraction with a block argument
  class MyClass
    include Twitter::Extractor
    extract_reply_screen_name("@twitter are you hiring?").do |username|
      # username = "twitter"
    end
  end

== Auto-linking Examples

  # Auto-link
  class MyClass
    include Twitter::Autolink

    html = auto_link("link @user, please #request")
  end

  # For Ruby on Rails you want to add this to app/helpers/application_helper.rb
  module ApplicationHelper
    include Twitter::Autolink
  end

  # Now the auto_link function is available in every view. So in index.html.erb:
  <%= auto_link("link @user, please #request") %>

=== Usernames

Username extraction and linking matches all valid Twitter usernames but does
not verify that the username is a valid Twitter account.

=== Lists

Auto-link and extract list names when they are written in @user/list-name
format.

=== Hashtags

Auto-link and extract hashtags, where a hashtag can contain most letters or
numbers but cannot be solely numbers and cannot contain punctuation.

=== URLs

Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean may not use a delimiter such as
a space to separate normal text from URLs making it difficult to identify where
the URL ends and the text starts.

For this reason twitter-text currently does not support extracting or auto-linking
of URLs immediately followed by non-Latin characters.

Example: "http://twitter.com/は素晴らしい" .
The normal text is "は素晴らしい" and is not part of the URL even though
it isn't space separated.

=== International

Special care has been taken to be sure that auto-linking and extraction work
in Tweets of all languages. This means that languages without spaces between
words should work equally well.

=== Hit Highlighting

Use to provide emphasis around the "hits" returned from the Search API, built
to work against text that has been auto-linked already.

=== Conformance

To run the Conformance suite, you'll need to add that project as a git submodule.  From the root twitter-text-rb directory, run:

  git submodule add git@github.com:twitter/twitter-text-conformance.git test/twitter-text-conformance/
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
